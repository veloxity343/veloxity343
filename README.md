## <p align="center">(Obligatory) Hello, World! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NKfNftS.gif" width="30"> </p>
### Thanks for surfin' over! 🌊 <br>
I'm Ryan, a self-proclaimed coding wizard 🧙‍♂️✨ on an important quest to transform coffee ☕ and late nights 🌒 into code!<br>
What you see here is the place where I open-source some cool stuff while trying my utmost not to break anything important.<br>
<br>
Some stuff you might want to know:<br>

about_Me = {
	"pronouns": "he" || "him" || "apache helicopter 🚁 ",
	"code": ["C", "Python"],
	"tools": ["Git", "Visual Studio Code", "PyCharm"],
	"funFact": "I speak fluent sarcasm but my code sometimes speaks in tongues",
	"hobbies": ["Scuba diving 🤿 ", "Swimming", "Gaming", "Debugging",

};

### 📜 The Adventurer's Guild<br>
- At this very moment? I'm probably saving the world, one bug fix at a time 🐛 and trying to convince my computer that "semicolon" is not a foreign language symbol<br>
- Really, I'm on a lifelong quest of self-learning, kind of like a certain hobbit searching for the perfect code ring 💍<br>
- Enrolled in the Hogwarts-equivalent of coding: [42 School](https://42kl.edu.my/), where the spells are 'git commit -m' and 'sudo pour me another glass!' 🥂<br>
- Trying to decide if I'm in a "productive coding flow" or just procrastinating 🤔<br>

### 💬 Let's Quest Together<br>
- When I'm not tangled in code, I'm probably lost in a good book 📚 ...or just lost, really<br>
- Looking for fellow adventurers to tackle the quest of creating the ultimate "404 Not Found" page. Spoiler: It'll be legendary! 🏰<br>
