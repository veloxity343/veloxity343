### (Obligatory) Hello, World! 👋

I'm Ryan, a self-proclaimed coding wizard 🧙‍♂️ on an important quest to transform coffee ☕ and late nights into code!
This is the place where I open-source stuff and try my utmost not to break anything important.

Here's what you might want to know about me:

about_Me = {
  "pronouns": "he" || "him" || "anything you want to call me",
  "code": ["C", "Python"],
  "tools": ["Git", "Visual Studio Code", "PyCharm"],
  "funFact": "I speak fluent sarcasm and my code sometimes speaks in tongues",
  "hobbies": ["Scuba diving", "Swimming", "Debugging", "Gaming", "Pretending to understand quantum computing"],
  "motto": "Eat, sleep, code, repeat. Sometimes forget to eat and sleep.",
};

📜 My Quest
Currently, probably saving the world one bug fix at a time 🐛 and trying to convince my computer that "semicolon" is not a foreign language symbol
Really, I'm on a lifelong quest of self-learning, kind of like a hobbit searching for the perfect code ring 💍
Enrolled in the Hogwarts-equivalent of coding: 42 School, where the spells are 'git commit -m' and 'sudo make me a sandwich'! 🧙‍♂️✨
Trying to decide if I'm in a "productive coding flow" or just procrastinating 🤔

💬 Let's Quest Together
When I'm not tangled in code, I'm probably lost in a good book 📚 ...or just lost, really
Looking for fellow adventurers to tackle the quest of creating the ultimate "404 Not Found" page. Spoiler: It'll be legendary! 🏰
Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out! Happy coding! 🎉
